# Shadow Removal on ISTD Dataset

The ISTD Dataset is proposed in *Stacked Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Jointly Learning Shadow Detection and Shadow Removal, Jifeng Wang, Xiang Li and Jian Yang, CVPR 2018*. Download from the the [Github repository](https://github.com/DeepInsight-PCALab/ST-CGAN).

## Color adjustment

The ISTD dataset has some color difference in the non-shadow area of the shadow/shadow-free pairs so some color adjustment is needed. The code used here is provided by the authors of *Shadow Removal via Shadow Image Decomposition, Hieu Le and Dimitris Samaras, ICCV 2019* (using MATLAB). Download from their [project website](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/projects/SID/index.html).
